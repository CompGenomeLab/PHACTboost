# PHACTboost

PHACTboost is a gradiatent boosting tree based classifier that combines PHACT scores with information from multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic trees, and ancestral reconstruction. Our comprehensive experiments on 20,191 human proteins encompassing 219 million amino acid substitution  demonstrate that PHACTboost overpeforms 40 available pathogenicity predictors  including the recent ones such as EVE and CPT-1.
